objectVariable.Join differentObjectVariable
Call objectVariable.Join(differentObjectVariable)


This method allows you to join data from another clsArray object. The different
array object content will be added to the end of the primary array object. If
you prefer it to be added to the front, see the Splice() method.

Since both objects are created and populated, one is joined to the other
with a simple statement:

objectVariable.Join differentObjectVariable

NOTE: If the primary object (objectVariable) has ForceValue or ForceUnique set
to true, then those paramters will be applied to the object array values that
are called to be joined.

Example:
Dim objectVariable as New clsArray
objectVariable.SetArrayFromString "Blue,Yellow,Gold"

Dim differentObjectVariable as New clsArray
differentObjectVariable.SetArrayFromString "Magenta,Fuschia,Aubergine"

objectVariable.Join differentObjectVariable

objectVariable.raw will now output: Blue,Yellow,Gold,Magenta,Fuschia,Aubergine
