The methods Shift() and Pop() will both remove elements at the ends of the array. To remove an item
that is not at either end of the array, you need to use the Remove() method. This requires that you
specify the inedex of the element.

However, you can also use the IndexOf() method to lookup the index of a text string (full match,
not a partial match).

METHOD No. 1: Using an 0-based integer for the index.

    objArray.Remove index:=4

METHOD No. 2: Using IndexOf() to look up the index of a word. Note that this IS case sensitive.

    objArray.Remove index:=objArray.IndexOf("whizbang")
