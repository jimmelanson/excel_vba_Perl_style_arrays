objectVariable.SortAscending
objectVariable.Reverse


You can sort the array asceding or descending. The sort is handled ascibettically. This means that
upper-case letters are sorted ahead of lower-case letters and numbers are sorted ahead of letters.

If you were to populate and array with this list:

Pears
salmon
101
Apples
one
two
Kiwis
416
527Simonds
alpha
gamma
beta
Kumquats
Dragon Fruits
three
four

... and then call the sorting on it:

    objArray.SortAscending

... then you would get this list as a result:

101
416
527Simonds
Apples
Dragon Fruits
Kiwis
Kumquats
Pears
alpha
beta
four
gamma
one
salmon
three
two


DESCENDING SORT:
If you wish to sort the other direction, descending, you need sort the list ascending and then reverse the list:

    objArray.SortAscending
    objArray.Reverse
