The default delimeter for this object is the comma. You can specify a different delimeter but
you must do so prior to passing the string of data to the object. You cannot change the
delimeter after you have begun populating the object.

    objArray.Delimeter = ":"

You can force the object to only accept non-null values. That is, you can force the object
to reject empty values. Remember, however, that a blank space is actually a real value.

    objArray.ForceValue = True

You can force the object to only accept unique values.

    objArray.ForceUnique = True
