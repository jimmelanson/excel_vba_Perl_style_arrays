objectVariable.Push ([string])
objectVariable.Push [string]
Call objectVariable.Push([string])

To add an element to the end of the array, use the Perl-style method Push

    Dim objArray As New clsArray
    objArray.Delimeter = ":"
    objArray.ForceValue = True
    Dim strMyStuff As String
    strMyStuff = "Pears:Apples:Grapes:Bananas:Kiwis"
    objArray.SetArrayFromString content:=strMyStuff

To add one item:
    objArray.Push content:="Dragon Fruit"

To add several items from a worksheet:
    Dim i as Integer
    For i = 1 To 20
        objArray.Push Cells(i, 1).Value
    Next i
    
NOTE: Since I turned on the ForceValue flag, I don't need to check the cell for any content
as the class method will do that.

NOTE: The FOR-LOOP in this example adds items one at a time. This is useful if you want
to process the items before adding them. You can add multiple items in one statement
by using Splice() or Join().
