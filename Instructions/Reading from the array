There is only one way to read from the array, by looking at the element at a specific index position.
There are, however, a few different approaches.

METHOD No. 1 - When you know the index:

    strItem = objArray.Element(4)

METHOD No. 2 - Iterating through all the items front to back

    Dim i as Integer
    For i = 0 to objArray.LastIndex
        strItem = objArray.Element(i)
        ... do nifty stuff with strItem ...
    Next i
    
METHOD No. 3 - Iterating through all the items back to front
               NOTE: Never use this back-to-front direction with Shift() or Pop() or Remove()

    Dim i as Integer
    For i = objArray.LastIndex to 0 Step -1
        strItem - objArray.Element(i)
        ... do nifty stuff with strItem ...
    Next i
