There are three methods that tell you how many items in the list. Assume we are
working with this list of five items: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Purple

1-based integer of elements in the list
    objArray.CountElements
    -> This returns the number 5
    
0-based integer of index positions in the list
    objArray.CountRemaining
    -> This returns the number 4

0-based integer of index positions in the list
    objArray.LastIndex
    -> This returns the number 4

The last two, objArray.LastIndex and objArray.CountRemaining are intrinsically
identical. The method LastIndex() was added purely for the ease of remembering
the name to get the value.
