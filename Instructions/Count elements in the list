There are two methods that tell you how many items in the list. Assume we are
working with this list of five items: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Purple

1-based value of elements in the list
    objArray.CountElements
    -> This returns the number 5 as a Long data type
    
0-based integer of index positions in the list
    objArray.LastIndex
    -> This returns the number 4 as Long data type



IF you want to FOR-LOOP through your array, you can use either one:

For i = 0 to objArray.LastIndex
    Debug.Print objArray.Element(i - 1)
Next i
or

For i = 1 to objArray.CountElements
    Debug.Print objArray.Element(i - 1)
Next i



If you are going to remove each item from the array as you process it,
then you can use a DO-WHILE-LOOP with the CountElements() like this:

Do While objArray.CountElements > 0
    strValue = objArray.Shift
    Debug.Print strValue
Loop
