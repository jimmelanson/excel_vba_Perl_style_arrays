NOTE: Make sure you are removing items when using a Do-While loop, or that you implement
some counter to make sure you don't end up in an infinite loop.

Dim objectVariable as New clsArray
objectVariable.SetArrayFromString = strContentICreated

Dim strThisItem as String
Dim i as Long
Do While objectVariable.CountElements > 0
    strThisItem = objectVariable.Shift
    ...OR...
    strThisItem = objectVariable.Pop
Loop
