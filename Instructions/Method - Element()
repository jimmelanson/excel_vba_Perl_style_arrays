stringVariable = objArray.Element([index])


The Element() method retrieves the content at a specific index position.
There are a few different approaches to this.

METHOD No. 1 - When you know the index:

    stringVariable = objArray.Element(4)

METHOD No. 2 - Iterating through all the items front to back

    Dim i as Integer
    For i = 0 to objArray.LastIndex
        stringVariable = objArray.Element(i)
        ... do nifty stuff with strItem ...
    Next i
    
METHOD No. 3 - Iterating through all the items back to front
               NOTE: Never use this back-to-front direction with Shift() or Pop() or Remove()

    Dim i as Integer
    For i = objArray.LastIndex to 0 Step -1
        stringVariable - objArray.Element(i)
        ... do nifty stuff with strItem ...
    Next i


NOTE: In addition to this method, you can also extract content with Grep() and Slice().

NOTE: To edit the content at a specific index position, see Edit().
