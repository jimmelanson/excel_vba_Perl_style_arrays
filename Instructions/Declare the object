In the VBA Editor, make sure you import the file "clsArray.cls" and then save the workbook. You can now access the class anywhere in that workbook project space.

You MUST use early binding for this object. In this example, that means you MUST use the keyword "New"

Dim objArray As New clsArray

DO NOT use late binding like the following as it will cause the object to pitch numerous exceptions.
Dim objArray As clsArray
