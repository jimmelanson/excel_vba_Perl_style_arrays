In the VBA Editor, make sure you import the class module "clsArray.cls" and then save the workbook. You can now access the class anywhere in that workbook project space.

You MUST use early binding for this object. In this example, that means you MUST use the keyword "New" when declaring the object variable.

Dim objArray As New clsArray
