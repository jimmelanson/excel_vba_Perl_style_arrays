[boolean value] = objectVariable.Splice([index], [content])


The Splice() method allows you to apply a string list of items to any position in the
array object. It will return True if successful and False if not.

INSERT POSITION
The position at which you are going to insert the new data is expressed as a 0-based
index of the array. NOTE: The position indicated and everything following it will be
shifted to the right or to the end of the array. The new data supplied will begin
appearing at the index position indicated.

For example, if you are adding "Mustard,Ketcup,Onions" to the existing list of
"Relish,Hot Peppers,Pickles,Tomatoes" at index position 3 then you will wind up
with the array ordered: Relish,Hot Peppers,Mustard,Ketchup,Onions,Pickles,Tomatoes

And now I'm hungry.

INDEX OF
You can determine the index position you want to insert at by looping through the array
and finding the item that indicates the start position. It would be much faster to
use IndexOf(). NOTE: It only returns the first element matched.

longIndex = objectVariable.IndexOf([string])


INDEX OF REGEX
There is also a method called IndexOfRegex() that will return the FIRST element that
matches the pattern. NOTE: It only returns the first element matched.

longFirstIndex = objArray.IndexOfRegex("\d{3}\.")

NOTE: If you are searching text, you can make it case insensitive with the flag
for this method, objectVariable.IndexOfRegexIgnoreCase = True


INSERT CONTENT
The string list you are adding can be formed several ways:

AS VARIABLE
If you are adding data derived from another source, concatenate it into a string with
the proper delimeter and then add it. Note that it must be in the format:
    itemDELIMETERitemDELIMETERitemDELIMETER

objectVariable.Splice(4, strNewData)

AS GREP RESULTS
You can splice data from a Grep() on this array or on another clsArray object

objectVariable.Splice(objectVariable.IndexOf("Sony"), differentObjectVariable.Grep("^c"))

AS SLICE RESULTS
You can use slice to help reorganize your array:

objectVariable.Splice(2, objectVariable.Slice(8, 3))
