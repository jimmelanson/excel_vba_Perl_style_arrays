DELIMETER
The default delimeter for this object is the comma. You can specify a different delimeter but
you must do so prior to passing the string of data to the object. You cannot change the
delimeter after you have begun populating the object.

    objectVariable.Delimeter = ":"


FORCE VALUE
You can force the object to only accept non-null values. That is, you can force the object
to reject empty values. Remember, however, that a blank space is actually a real value and
will get added. Make sure you process your data before adding it!

    objectVariable.ForceValue = True


FORCE UNIQUE
You can force the object to only accept unique values. Note that this applies to the methods:
Push(), UnShift(), SetArray(), SetArrayFromList(), Splice(), Join()

    objArray.ForceUnique = True


IGNORE CASE
The three methods that apply a regular expression to content being passed to it allow you to
specify whether that content will be evaluated case-sensitive or case-insensitive.

You should problably think of these backwards, as they are a bit counter intuitive. The default
for each of these methods is to be case-SENSITIVE. Therefore, to turn off case sensitivity,
you set these values to TRUE so that the method will start to ignore the case of the content.

Grep()

Slice()

Remove()
