longIndex = objectVariable.IndexOf([exact string])
longIndex = objectVariable.IndexOfRegex([regex pattern])


There are several ways to find the index of a particular item in the array object.
You can loop through the array and examine each object yourself, or use one of
the two index return methods.

IndexOf
This requires you provide an exact match for the item you are seeking. For example:
longItemIndex = objectVariable.IndexOf("42AS-34E9-22FG-01")

IndexOfRegex
If you are looking for the first serial number with two digits at the start and at
the end, then you would not be able to use an exact match. In this case use a regex
pattern.

longItemIndex = objectVariable.IndexOfRegex("^\d\d.+\d\d$")
