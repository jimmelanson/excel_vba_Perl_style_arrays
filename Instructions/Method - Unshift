objectVariable.UnShift ([string])
objectVariable.UnShift [string]
Call objectVariable.UnShift([string])

To add an element to the front of the array, use the Perl-style method Unshift

    Dim objArray As New clsArray
    objArray.Delimeter = ":"
    objArray.ForceValue = True
    Dim strMyStuff As String
    strMyStuff = "Pears:Apples:Grapes:Bananas:Kiwis"
    objArray.SetArrayFromString content:=strMyStuff

To add one item to the front of the array:
    objArray.UnShift "Dragon Fruit"

To add several items from a worksheet, putting each one at the front of the array:
    Dim i as Integer
    For i = 1 To 20
        objArray.UnShift Cells(i, 1).Value
    Next i
    
NOTE: Since I turned on the ForceValue flag, I don't need to check the cell for any content
as the class method will do that.

NOTE: The FOR-LOOP in this example adds items one at a time. This is useful if you want
to process the items before adding them. You can add multiple items in one statement
by using Splice() or Join().
