To add an element to the front of the array, use the Perl-style method Unshift

    Dim objArray As New clsArray
    objArray.Delimeter = ":"
    objArray.ForceValue = True
    Dim strMyStuff As String
    strMyStuff = "Pears:Apples:Grapes:Bananas:Kiwis"
    objArray.SetArrayFromString content:=strMyStuff

To add one item:
    objArray.Unshift content:="Dragon Fruit"

To add several items from a worksheet:
    Dim i as Integer
    For i = 1 To 20
        objArray.Unshift content:=Cells(i, 1).Value
    Next i
    
NOTE: Since I turned on the ForceValue flag, I don't need to check the cell for any content
as the class method will do that.
